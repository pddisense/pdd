title: Get started with Private Data Donor
---

This page is a quickstart guide design to help you getting started with the Private Data Donor program.
You will learn how to install the Chrome extension on your computer, and start helping the science by joining a collection campaign.
Thank you for your help!

## 1. Install the extension

The first step to get started is to install the Google Chrome extension.
As of now, we only support Google Chrome, but could develop extensions for other web browsers if our initiative receives enough traction.
Please let us know if you would like to see another web browser supported!

The extension is distributed via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

You simply have to click on the "Add to Chrome" button.
The extension then asks you for a single permission: to read and change your browsing history.

We need to have access to your browsing in order to monitor the search queries you perform.
But do not worry, you can [view the data we collect](./history) in real-time and even delete a search query before it is sent if you do not want to share it with us.
Moreover, most of the collection campaigns come with [a privacy-preserving encryption layer](./privacy) that helps protect your privacy.

## 2. Join your first campaign
Once the extension is installed, you probably want to join a collection campaign.
Campaigns are launched by researchers who are interested in monitoring certain keywords, in order to detect or follow the evolution of infectious diseases. 
You choose which campaigns you want to participate to, and can join and leave campaigns at any time.
However, for your contribution to be helpful and help us advance the research, we recommend that you commit to a campaign for a certain amount of time (e.g., a couple of weeks).

To join a campaign, head to the "Campaigns" tab of the extension options.
The options are open when you first install the extension, and otherwise accessible through the PDD button that appeared at the right side of the address bar.

To join a campaign, click on its name, review its information, and if you agree click on the "Join the campaign" button.
A final dialog opens, asking for a confirmation.
Click again on the "Join this campaign" button, and *voil√†*!

## 3. Next steps
Now, the PDD extension is running and monitoring your search queries in the background.
You have nothing more to do, everything is automated.
