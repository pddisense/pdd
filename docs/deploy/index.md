# Administrator guide

The administrator guide is intended to whomever which to operate a Private Data Donor instance, either the official one or a personalised one.
However, please not that for now we do not officially support installing a personalised Data Donor instance.
Should you have the need to do so, we recommend that you [contact us](mailto:pddisense@ucl.ac.uk) first.
