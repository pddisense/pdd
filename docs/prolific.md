This page is intended for participants coming from the [Prolific platform](https://www.prolific.ac/).
It provides instructions to get started.
To participate to the study, you should fulfill the following requirements:

* Be using Chrome (or Chromium) as your main Web browser.
* Be using Google on a daily basis to perform searches.

## 1. Install the Chrome extension

The Private Data Donor is hosted on the official Chrome Web Store, on the following page: 
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/private-data-donor/ipeekohlgfhagcopnndkgoommcihmdmk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/private-data-donor/ipeekohlgfhagcopnndkgoommcihmdmk)

Then, click on the blue button labeled "Add to Chrome" to actually install the extension.

## 2. Fill in your Prolific ID

Just after the extension is installed, the options page should open automatically.
If it is not the case, or if you already closed it, you can access the options at any time by clicking on the button that has appeared at the far right of your address bar:

Then click on the "Settings" tab, and fill in your Prolific ID:

**Take care of mentioning the Prolific ID that has been assigned to you by the platform.**
This step is important to allow us to verify that you actually installed the extension, validate your participation and ultimately your payment.

## 3. Confirm your participation on Prolific

Now that the extension is installed and configured, please confirm your participation on the Prolific platform, by visiting the following page:

## 4. Keep using Chrome and Google for a week

The only thing we ask you is to use Chrome to perform Google searches on a daily basis.
You do not have to change your behaviour, the extension is simply running on the background.
For your payment to be performed in full, we require to receive at least **6 days of data (out of 7)**.
 
After that period of time, you may freely remove the extension from your browser.
